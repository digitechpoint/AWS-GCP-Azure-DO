## Zip everything in current directory

If you'd like to compress and package everything, including files and folders in current directory, into a single ZIP file on Ubuntu.


``zip -r foo.zip .``


How to extract only a specific folder from a zipped archive to a given directory?

```unzip /path/to/archive.zip 'in/archive/folder/*' -d /path/to/unzip/to```
