For those trying to move folder, on Ubuntu using Putty, just use the following command:

`sudo mv /fromPath/ /toPath/`

example 1:

`sudo mv /root/folder1 /home/folder2/`

example 2:

`sudo mv /home/digitechpoint/apps/domain.com/public/wp/ /home/digitechpoint/apps/domain.com/`



"/" in the end means you are going to move folder1 inside folder2

If you don't, you will get "no such file or directory"
